NOTE: This project is not yet ready for general use. We're still figuring out
what we want it to do and what interfaces it should provide for users.

----

Overview: This project is intended to provide tooling that bridges several gaps
users have with various SSL/TLS.

Goals:

* Provide actionable diagnostic and error messages for SSL/TLS problems.
* Clearer explanations of problems when they occur.
* Help users break the habit of disabling certificate validation

Delivery:

1. A command-line tool to help users diagnose and repair SSL/TLS problems.
2. A Java library that can be used from other applications to provide users with actionable SSL/TLS diagnostics.
