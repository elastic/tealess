My intent with this project is to provide tooling that bridges several
gaps users have with various SSL/TLS. I hope to:

* Provide actionable diagnostic and error messages for SSL/TLS problems.
* Clearer explanations of problems when they occur.
* Help users break the habit of disabling certificate validation

I hope to provide this tooling through two interfaces:

1. A command-line tool to help users diagnose and repair SSL/TLS problems.
2. A Java library that can be used from other applications to provide users with actionable SSL/TLS diagnostics.
